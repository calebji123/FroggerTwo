# FroggerTwo

It started off as a final project for my grade 10 computer science course. I liked the idea of the game so much that I decided to immortalize it on github. Afterwards, I tried to finish it, but did not succeed. It currently is very buggy, but displays an idea. If one day I improve my game development skills, I may return to this idea.

Processing is neither comprehensive nor easy to work with. However, it is simple and good for beginner programmers. As a result, I do not wish to continue coding with this tool. I ported it to javascript using Processing.js.
